title: Introducing Fekyll
---

Managing content with Jekyll is powerful and easy.
Manipulating style with Foundation 5 allows for massive change quickly.
Fekyll allows you to run `compass watch` on the `/foundation` directory
while running `jekyll serve -w` on the `\jekyll` directory in order
to rapidly prototype content and style.

Fekyll is built on Foundation 5, Jekyll, and Poole.

This is the first iteration that I cooked up today.
The final goal of Fekyll is to allow for easily customizable and
beautiful user and organization Github pages.
